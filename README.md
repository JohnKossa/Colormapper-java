# Colormapper-java
Takes in an image and produces a palette of colors, then repaints the image based on its palette.

## Background
I wrote this as part of an independant study project for my AI course in college. It uses a self-organizing map to "sample" from image colors to create a palette. Then to test the palette, it attempts to redraw the first image with the palette it created.

## Future Work
None

I'm just putting this here for archival purposes. I may rewrite this program at a later date with Rust or something.
